# Sales analysis Assignement
Maeva Braeckevelt

During the Covid19 pandemic, every company had to adapt to the new measures. Restaurants were particularly
challenged in order to stay profitable. Managers of restaurants struggle to staff their restaurant
accordingly. I decided to analyze how certain variables affect the sales during this special period.

# Analytic plan #
In this folder, there are four folders required for the data analysis and coding project.

## Codes
* This folder contains R scripts and 2 Rmarkdown used to create my analysis about sales

## Data
* This folder contains one subfolder : 
It contains csv files : raw datable and variable file

## Docs
* The docs folder contains a PDF and a HTML. They both have the same content : My final analysis of the sales

## Outputs
* the folder contains a self-standing html containing a model comparison of the different model of regression used in my analysis.
