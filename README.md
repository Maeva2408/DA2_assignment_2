# Sales analysis Assignement
Maeva Braeckevelt

During this Covid19 pandemic, every company had to adapt to the new measures. Restaurant were particularly challenged in order to stay profitable. Managers of restaurant struggle to staff their restaurant accordingly. I decided to analyze how certain variables affect the sales during this special period.

# Analytic plan #
In this folder, there are four folders required for the data analysis et coding project.

## Codes
* This folder contains R scripts and 2 Rmarkdown used to create my analysis about Covid-19

## Data

It contains csv files : raw datable and variable file

## Docs
